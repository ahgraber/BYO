# BYO
## Bring Your Own (function)

This repo is to be a collection of self-written functions (in both R and Python3).

### Functions:
	* normalize
	* standardize
	* Error functions
	    * Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)
	    * Mean Squared Error (MSE)
	    * Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
	* Distance functions
	    * Correlation (as distance between two vectors) (cor_d)
	    * Euclidean distance (euc_d)
	    * Cosine similarity (cos_d)
	    * Jaccard similarity (jaccard_d)
	* k-fold Cross-Validation
	* gradient descent'
	* stochastic search heuristics' 
	    * Simulated Annealing'
	    * Genetic Algorithm'
	* Linear Regression / Prediction'
	* LASSO Regression / Prediction'
	* Logistic Regression / Prediction'
	* Neural Network'
	* k-Nearest Neighbors'

Note: ' indicates still in progress
